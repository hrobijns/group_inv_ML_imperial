# Geometric analysis with machine learning: summer project with Imperial College, London
Summer project supervised by Daniel Platt (Imperial College, London, maths department) and Daattavya Argarwal (Cambridge University, computer science department).

## Packages and requirements:
- Python
- TensorFlow

## Contents:

### Pre-project work:

prep_work.py:
- defined and trained a simple classification neural network, allowing us to predict Sasakian Hodge numbers from their respective weights, essentially reproducing the result in [this paper (1)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269324000753?via%3Dihub).
- experimented with different architecture to improve accuracy.
- mainly an educational/warm-up exercise to introduce NNs in the context of algebraic topology.

### Project 1: Other ML techniques, incl. group invariant ML
Based on the same paper as the pre-project work [(1)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269324000753?via%3Dihub), we attempted to improve the results, especially of the CN invariant which was predicted little better than random guessing. This was done through trying different ML techniques, including group invariant ML.
